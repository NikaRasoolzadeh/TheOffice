# Exploring "The Office" TV Series Dataset

### Objective

The task is to create a report on the given dataset using Jupyter.

### Brief

Everyone loves "The Office," a popular show that aired from 2005 to 2013. While doing research, I stumbled across this dataset, with the lines of all the episodes.
I decided to explore the dataset and answer some questions in a Jupyter notebook.

### Tasks

In this notebook the following questions are answered:

-   How many characters are there? What are their names?
-   For each character, find out who has the most lines across all episodes
-   What is the average of words per line for each character?
-   What is the most common word per character
-   Number of episodes where the character does not have a line, for each character
-   Number of time "That's what she said" joke comes up
    -   Include five examples of the joke
-   The average percent of lines each character contributed each episode per season.
